# Twotter

Twotter is an open source, privacy focused alternative to Twitter. It is built for people who want to share short thoughts without being tracked, profiled, or fed ads. It looks like Twitter, feels like Twitter, but legally it is not Twitter.

## Features

- Privacy first: no trackers, no ads, no analytics  
- Micro posting: post short thoughts and reply to others  
- Open source: free to modify, self host, or contribute  
- Clean interface: familiar layout, minimal design  
- Community driven: no corporate influence or algorithmic bias  

## Goals

Twotter aims to give users control over their data and their timelines. We do not track users, we do not show promoted content, and we do not manipulate what you see. This is a platform for real posts, in real time.

## Getting Started

To run Twotter locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ai0la/twotter.git
cd twotter
# run your backend and frontend setup here
````
